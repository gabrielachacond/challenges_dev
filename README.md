***This repository is related to the 2 technical challenges:***

#### Minimal difference

Given two arrays of integers, compute the pair of values (one value in each array) with the smallest (non-negative) difference. Return the difference.

###### Examples

const a = [1, 3, 15, 11, 2];
const b = [23, 127, 235, 19, 8];

smallestDifference(a, b); // output: 3


const a = [10, 5, 40];
const b = [50, 90, 80];

smallestDifference(a, b); // output: 10




#### Non-constructible change

Given an array of positive integers representing the values of coins in your possession, write a function that returns the minimum amount of change (the minimum sum of money) that you cannot create. The given coins can have any positive integer value and aren't necessarily unique (i.e., you can have multiple coins of the same value).

For example, if you're givencoins = [1, 2, 5], the minimum amount of change that you can't create is 4. If you're given no coins, the minimum amount of change that you can't create is 1.

###### Sample Test
coins = [5, 7, 1, 1, 2, 3, 22]

###### Sample Output
20


**The expected behavior of both challenges has been checked by unit test**
